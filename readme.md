### Project: Personal Finance Manager

**Description**: Create a comprehensive personal finance manager application that helps users track their income, expenses, budgets, and investments. This project will involve complex features such as user authentication, data visualization, and financial calculations.

### Features:

1.  **User Authentication**:
    
    -   Implement user registration, login, and password management using JWT for authentication.
2.  **Dashboard**:
    
    -   A summary dashboard displaying an overview of the user's financial status, including total income, total expenses, budget status, and recent transactions.
3.  **Income and Expense Tracking**:
    
    -   Allow users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries. Each entry should have a date, category, description, and amount.
4.  **Budget Management**:
    
    -   Users can set monthly budgets for different categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, rent). The app should track spending against these budgets and alert users when they are nearing their limits.
5.  **Investment Tracking**:
    
    -   Track investments in various assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.), including purchase dates, amounts, and current values. Provide an overview of the portfolio performance.
6.  **Data Visualization**:
    
    -   Visualize financial data using charts and graphs (e.g., pie charts for expense categories, line charts for income and expense trends).
7.  **Reports and Analytics**:
    
    -   Generate monthly, quarterly, and yearly financial reports. Provide insights and analytics on spending habits and saving trends.
8.  **Responsive Design**:
    
    -   Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies:

-   **PostgreSQL**: For storing user data, transactions, budgets, and investment records.
-   **Express.js**: For building the backend API to handle requests and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
-   **React**: For creating the frontend user interface, including forms, dashboards, and visualizations.
-   **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for the backend.

### Steps to Implement:

1.  **Setup**:
    
    -   Initialize a new Node.js project and set up Express.js.
    -   Set up PostgreSQL database and configure the connection with your Node.js application.
    -   Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
2.  **Authentication**:
    
    -   Implement user registration and login using JWT.
    -   Set up protected routes in Express and React to ensure only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.
3.  **Database Design**:
    
    -   Design and create PostgreSQL tables for users, income, expenses, budgets, and investments.
    -   Write SQL queries or use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize) to interact with the database.
4.  **Backend API**:
    
    -   Develop RESTful API endpoints for managing income, expenses, budgets, and investments.
    -   Implement middleware for authentication and validation.
5.  **Frontend Development**:
    
    -   Create React components for the dashboard, forms, and data visualizations.
    -   Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization.
    -   Integrate the frontend with the backend API using Axios or Fetch API.
6.  **Testing**:
    
    -   Write unit and integration tests for both the backend and frontend.
    -   Use tools like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress for testing.
7.  **Deployment**:
    
    -   Deploy the backend server and PostgreSQL database to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
    -   Deploy the frontend application to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

### Additional Features (Optional):

-   **Recurring Transactions**: Support for recurring income and expenses (e.g., monthly salary, rent).
-   **Multi-currency Support**: Handle multiple currencies and provide conversion rates.
-   **Notifications**: Email or SMS notifications for budget alerts or important financial updates.
-   **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version using React Native.
